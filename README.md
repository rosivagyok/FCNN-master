# FCNN (Fusion Convolutional Neural Networks)

A semester project submitted to Aalborg University, where we experimented with different CNN trackers and Fusion. 

This is the initial code of the submitted project, the final results and the new methods included in the advanced version of the fusion algorithm, can be seen in the presentation files! (FCNN-master/Project Presentation/Exam presentation.pdf)

To run the test demo of the fusion network, run FCNN-master/Trackers/FCNN/setup.m, then FCNN-master/Trackers/FCNN/demo.m
