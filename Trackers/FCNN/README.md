# Trackers

The following trackers where studied and experimented with:

**MDNET** - Learning Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Tracking. [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07945)] & [[Project](https://github.com/HyeonseobNam/MDNet)]

**C-COT** - Beyond Correlation Filters: Learning Continuous
Convolution Operators for Visual Tracking. [[Paper](http://www.cvl.isy.liu.se/research/objrec/visualtracking/conttrack/C-COT_ECCV16.pdf)] & [[Project](https://github.com/martin-danelljan/Continuous-ConvOp)]

**TCNN** -
